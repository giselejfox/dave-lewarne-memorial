He was the perfect person to RUN THIS TOWN! XC was the one place where people in the back mattered just as much as people in the front. LeWarne made that possible. He seemed more concerned about building character than winning. He made running fun with things like: Watermelon run, team dinners, trips: Monteray, CA, Redwoods, swimming in the ocean, Tillamook Mud Run, running to hit golf balls, meat-locker, poker runs, cereal boxes hidden at Lord Hill. Annual favorite was Dirty Face camp, running up 4000ft, playing Yahtzee, Ice cream run, bacon explosion. Supporting others through: Alex Hopkins Memorial Run, Pumpkin Runs for grade school kids, helping at Eason & Special Olympics. He was great about including people in a casual Turkey Trot ‚Äì never for fastest time, but building community.  I would like to continue this tradition in his honor."

He was always helping them with projects and ensuring their wellbeing. He once told me, \"Any time Dad wants to barbeque, I show up to make sure nothing goes wrong.\" He, along with Charlie and Anne, have been wonderful kids to their parents. I grieve for the family with this unexpected tragic loss of a son, brother and father. Chuck and Pauline raised some great kids, and those kids, including David, have reciprocated in caring for their folks. What more can we say, except David was a terrific son."

Most usually Coach would have at least one or two of his sweet daughters tagging along with him, and in later years as Panthers training with their teammates.

He followed up on these words with actions, creating a space that kids wanted to come and just be themselves. He brought joy and laughter to practice and races, ‚Äúif I can write it you can run it‚Äù, and supported all runners at the back of the pack just as he did the front. He fostered a sense of community in his annual bacon-explosions with an ever-expanding open-door policy of an invite list. He helped us to feel both welcomed and celebrated for our weird teenage idiosyncrasies (but didn‚Äôt shy at an opportunity to roast us mid-run), and also held us to the standards he believed we were capable of. He made big daunting races or life decisions feel approachable and supported. He came to the hospital (and also brought me a milkshake and an autographed drawing from Jane) after I broke my leg and my teenage world felt devastated. When I was torn about where to go to college I went to his class at lunch and he encouraged and ultimately helped me decide on Gonzaga. He road-tripped to Eugene, OR to come watch a race at Hayward, and was always up to date on milestone races with encouraging texts or words of wisdom. He went out of his way to nerd out over how to help me be a better runner, and also remember how to be a good kind thoughtful patient person.
