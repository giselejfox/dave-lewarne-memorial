To this day, when we play cards, its still always 3 to 13, we always reminisce about you,  and we still need a card shuffler. And sometimes theres a little JYD involved! You taught me about being a dedicated teacher that does more than teach content, but to love your students and meet them where they are and with what they need. You shared your dog for the Furry 5K, you taught us to always take our kids out for pancakes on a snow day (I'll never forget walking down to Kate's with five babies and toddlers in tobogans!), had mountain bike adventures with Steve (until that didn't end well), but most of all you made us feel welcomed into your heart and family.

We told him how anxious we were and he told us that no matter what happened and how we ran, the sun would still come up the next day, and the world would keep spinning. As a nervous teenager, this put me at ease. He always wanted us to try our best, but he also never pushed too hard or made us feel pressured. He fostered an inclusive and uplifting team culture. LeWarne always cared about our well-being and our lives outside of school or XC. When I decided to apply to colleges in Ireland, he wrote me a recommendation letter that nearly brought my mom to tears. He helped me achieve my goals and I am very grateful to have known him. "

I can't fathom how different my life would be without the impact that running had on me, and I owe that to LeWarne. Growing up I didn't have a lot of positive support, so as a freshman runner, I was amazed that teammates and coaches cheered for me during races. I was so thankful that I would smile and wave thanks to them. LeWarne had to teach me how to race and helped me to build some confidence. He would tease me in his own goofy way about how I probably could run faster if I could smile and wave at everyone. I am forever grateful and am proud that I was one of his athletes.

I first met him through XC, but over the time I‚Äôve known him, he‚Äôs become so much more than a coach for me. LeWarne was able to balance the high expectations he held his athletes to with genuine care for our wellbeing and future. His personality filled every room he stepped into, and he brought an incredible vibrance to the XC team. He never let up, never settled for less, and always, always, wanted the best for everyone in his life. I‚Äôve never had more respect for anyone, ever. He made me want to succeed; if I was feeling rough one day and couldn‚Äôt put the work in for myself, I'd run for LeWarne. He supported me 100%, every day, through everything. Through failures and successes LeWarne was there, letting me know where to improve, what went wrong, and how to fix it. Above all else, he wanted to make sure that I never stopped pursuing the things he thought I was great at, even if I didn‚Äôt agree. The undeniably genuine nature of every interaction I had with him led me to trust LeWarne absolutely; if I was struggling with some issue, running-related or otherwise, LeWarne would be there to walk me through it. The little things he did, little quirks that at the time were easily overlooked, are now central to how I remember him, like him telling me freshman year not to call him ‚Äúcoach‚Äù because that felt like too much of a football thing (god forbid), or that little smirky smile he‚Äôd give me when I hit a PR; nothing has ever evoked a stronger sense of pride. We will always be your runners, and getting to captain under your leadership has been more valuable than any PR will ever be. You played a massive role in shaping me into someone I can be proud of, and I wish I could tell you that now, but it‚Äôs too late, and I waited too long. Really missing you, LeWarne. Love ya. "

I made sure after that year that he would be my teacher every year I was at SHS. I took Anatomy and Advanced Anatomy with him as well as TA‚Äôed for one of his Biology classes my Senior year. He would always walk around the classroom bending a yard stick that he would inevitably break from bending it too much. He must‚Äôve gone through at least 100 during my time at SHS. On my final day of class I brought him a yard stick and asked him to break it for me and sign it. He signed it ‚Äúdon‚Äôt break this‚Äù with his name. Today it still rests above my door as a reminder to not take life too seriously. I have been his student, his friend, and even taught his classes as a substitute teacher for the school district.

Thank you Dave for waxing me skis no one did it like you. One of my favorite things is when you‚Äôd be walking to the parking lot after the bell rings and the coolest people in the school would come step out on there little balcony in there tropical shirts yelling random crap and telling kids to have a good weekend. There‚Äôs truly no one like Dave Lewarne I think of that guy every step I take in snohomish because he‚Äôs the guy who kinda made me go run every block."

I never looked back after that moment. I grew to be the person I am today because of Dave, because of him taking me into his family, because of the culture he created in SHS cross country, and because of the belief he instilled in me and others to work hard for what we wanted. I know he would want us to continue celebrating his life on every run that we go on from now. Much love to the entire Lewarne and Fox family. "
